                                kickabout. A
                                colleague in work mentioned this website called Find Me Football who organised free
                                games of
                                football on a regular basis. I turned up to a game and had a great time and even made
                                some
                                friends. It was the best thing I had done and really helped my social life. I filled in

                                special games form so that I could be informed of any special games coming up too. I am

                                40, so my age makes me a bit more tired than some of the young players who play. I

                                sign up to the over 30's games when they come around."</span></p>

                                wasn't the only female player to turn up which made me feel really comfortable and felt

                                was all very inclusive. Me and another woman from that game have now joined a female

                                Manchester my old football team was full and so they couldn't take me on. I didn't know
                                if
                                the teams in my area had any space for me. So I tried to google teams which were still
                                taking players. By chance I came accross Find Me Football. I saw they had a search
                                football
                                team page so had a look. It seemed like the perfect thing for me to find a team. I
                                filled my
                                details in on the form and within days they had come back to me with 5 teams around
                                Manchester who were looking for players. I have now been playing for the team which Find
