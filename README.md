# **Find Me Football**


'Find Me Football' is a website for anyone who wants to play football in the Manchester area. There are two aspects of the website; one for people who are looking to play a game of football, and one for people who are looking to join a local football team. It happens very often that people are new to an area, or haven't played football for a long time, and don't know where to start to get back playing. Perhaps they don't know enough people to organise their own game, can't commit to a football league and so they just want to be able to join a game, or team, at a time and date that suits them. Find me football provides users with a simple way to register interest in joining a football game, or team, with everything being coordinated for them.
